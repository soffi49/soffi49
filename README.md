### Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹
I'm a PhD student at Warsaw University of Technology in the specialization Information and communication technology. ðŸ’» \
I have a M.Sc.Eng. in Computer Science and Information Systems. My master thesis was focused on resource allocation methods in carbon-aware clouds.
Currently, I continue my research on that topic, extending its scope to broadly perceived adaptable and distributed orchestration methods. \
In the context of this domain - I'm the author of the Extended Green Cloud Simulation (EGCS) framework, which facilitates simulation and modelling of green cloud infrastructures. 

Professionally, I simultaneously work as a researcher at the scientific institute and as a software developer in company, which gives me a multi-contextual perspective on the development of modern systems. 

I currently broaden my knowledge in `Typescript, Python` & `Java` \
Programming mainly in `Java, Python, React, React Native, C, C++, C#`,\
I love working on different kinds of projects, but I specialize in distributed systems, autonomous systems, and their sub-domain: **multi-agent systems**.
